                    based on Complex Social Network
                </h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>
                    There are close association between online social network and offline real world with interaction and
                    mapping relationship, which is feasible to build influence model for evaluation. Social network
                    study, especially based on the mobile Internet, focuses on dynamical evolving network with different
                    information transmission mechanism and influences model from the previous research. Big data
                    approaches forecast the change trend and realize the risk event surveillance and prediction.

                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                <p>
                    Online Social Network plays a significant role to improve the society development in commercial and
                    political level. Network Science, Web Science and Internet Science are three interdisciplinary areas
                    which enhance our understanding of complex systems from biological to technological and social [1,2].
                </p>

                <p>
                    Data collection in current world is ubiquitous and universal, whereas the interaction of human-data
                    ismundane both as a foreground technology (e.g., smartphones, iPad, wearable devices) and a background
                    technology (e.g., financial system, traffic management) [3]. Complex network analysis leverages big
                    data to expand the study field about the influence of information transmission and important event
                    (or risky event) forecasting, which is beneficial to both social stabilization and commercial development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Big data makes us better understand the real world, including satellite data, genetic data, GPS data,
                    and social media data, thus it is feasible to transfer “sampling” to “complete set”. Mobile Internet
                    and social network are the main trend of modern society, and it is of practical significance to study
                    on the information spreading mechanism and influence modeling, finding the human behavior change and
                    forecasting the potential risks [4].
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4>Literature Review</h4>

                <p>
                    Network Science can be traced to 18th century as mathematical study on graph theory by Leonard Euler [5].
                    The concept of “Sociometry” was proposed by Jascob Moreno[6], and soon after that, “Network Science”
                    drew on the anticipation of multi-disciplines such as physics, mathematics, computer science,
                    economies, neuroscience or even astronomy [7].
                </p>

                <p>
                    Albert-László Barabási asserts that they try to find the hidden pattern behind everything we do, and
                    the power law dominates most human behaviors that the characteristic of heterogeneity are manifested
                    both in the dimension of time and space [8]. With new tools provided by powerful but affordable
                    computers and computing software, researchers have made impressive gains in modeling and theorizing
                    the nature of networks as complex, large-scale, interactive systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alex Pentland is the director of the MIT Human Dynamics Lab and the Media Lab Entrepreneurship Program,
                    and major in the study of complexity science and network science from evolving dynamics aspect [9].
                    In fact, the development of social physics has experienced more than two decades, which indicates the
                    expectation to make society study definable and predictable by the method of mathematization and
                    theorization [10]. The study about human behavior, group behavior, thinking flow transmission,
                    and public opinion proliferation, all of which are similar to that energy changes the grain movement
                    by flowing among them [11,12].
                </p>
                <p>
                    A computational composite network model is developed to better predict human behavior (such as app
                    installation), which captures individual variance and exogenous factors [13].The traditional
                    influence model is expanded with different factors in different cases, and after processing,
                    integrating and analyzing the information, the risk prediction is more precise and general.
                </p>

                    Xin Lu is my teacher and colleague in the same laboratory. He focuses on mobile data analysis and
                    human behavior after disasters. Hidden Markov Chain and Movement Entropy are the main approach to
                    make population displacement predictability [14]. RDS (Respondent-driven sampling) is used for the
                    study of HIV/AIDS-related high risk populations and the estimation precision is improved by ego
                    network data about their personal networks [15]. To protect the privacy of mobile data and better
                    supervise the public health in the hyper-connected world, researchers construct Flowminder Foundation
                    and pursue further studies [16].
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Objectives and Methodology</h4>

                <p>
                    The model of influence is unobservable network where the explanation and prediction can be extracted
                    by the observable (or physical) networks. In my study, the research can be divided into three main
                    parts: the dynamical network modeling, the information transmission modeling (the influence model),
                    and the prediction algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Albeit many studies show that the human social network is always scale-free network with heterogeneity,
                    there are still many difficulties to build the network model reflecting the real world [17,18]:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single-level network is hard to reflect the real relationship among individuals;</li>
                    <li>
                        Behavior change and influence transmission is not only affected by the network structure but also
                        interfered by the extra factors;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is not denial about the individual difference that “rumors stop by the sage”, so some
                        characteristics in specific cases of small groups are not general and extendible.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Different contagion hypothesis are made under different conditions, that different cases have
                    different optimal parameters. Some information (or thoughts) are easily transferred with only one
                    contact, while others are spread along with the relationship of network and always have cascade
                    transformation.
                </p>
                <p>
                Prediction algorithms are numerous and we choose the one that can be corrected constantly by collected
                    data with strong robustness. Probability theory based on composite network model can improve the
                    Spread Trend Forecast precision by intelligent optimization algorithm, changing the estimation
                    problem to optimization problem during the model-training step [19, 20]. Distributed management
                    of data also plays an important part. EMBER, an automated 24*7 continuous system for forecasting
                    civil unrest across 10 countries of Latin America using open source indicators such as tweets,
                    news source, blogs, economic indicators and other data sources. Through numerous evaluations,
                    the superiority of EMBERS demonstrates the capability to forecast significant societal happenings [21,22].
                </p>

                <p>
                    Moreover, to adjust the model parameters, we need an index system to evaluate the prediction precision
                    and efficiency.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Preliminary Work and Prospective Outcomes</h4>
                <p>
                    Due to the interdisciplinary characteristics of this research field, I have already prepared some
                    essential knowledge and skills and published some papers as preliminary study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I propose the approximate maximum network lifetime by establishing the WSN (wireless sensor network)
                    routing strategy planning model, and the network energy consumption also gets reduction by controlling
                    the weight coefficient [23].<i>“Epidemic Spreading Characteristics and Immunity Measures Based on
                    Complex Network with Contact Strength and Community Structure”</i> demonstrates the modeling of
                    epidemiology with community structure based on contact strength and SI model, and a weighted network
                    based on BBV network model. After the verification by the real data of MERS, it is found that the
                    spreading rate is closely related to the average weight of network but not the number of communities [24].
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the research, I plan to publish 3-4 top ranked Journal and/or conference papers such as
                    (but not limited to):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nature Communications</li>
                    <li>PNAS <i>(Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences)</i></li>

                <p>
                    It is expected that the findings and outcomes in this research will have much more significance and deliver several advantages in both theory and practice:
