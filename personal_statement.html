                <p>
                    Data is a kind of valued strategic resources in the network era, yet mastering the data is insufficient.
                    Instead, only with good command of data processing ability can I acquire the useful information inside it.
                    Widely applied in business administration, production control, market analysis, engineering design and
                    scientific exploration, data mining and analysis is closely bound up with our life. As for me, the
                    undergraduate and postgraduate study in China has enormously sparked my interest in data processing,
                    as well allowed me to better understand the significance of adding value to data through the processing.
                    In consequence, I wish to take PhD study at University of Oxford, joining in your Internet Institute,
                    further deepening my knowledge structure and research ability and dedicating myself to the future development
                    of data processing. Moreover, I firmly believe that I am a qualified and competitive applicant judging from
                    my previous study and experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Academically, I obtained my BEng degree in Systems Engineering at National University of Defense Technology in
                    2014 and gained acceptance into postgraduate study here with top ranking among the department, waived all the
                    entrance examinations. In the past years, my fervent interest and ambition spurred me to study in such an arduous
                    way and made constant progress, and most of the major modules since the junior year have reached 90/100,
                    which could be seen from my transcript. My academic excellence also won me several scholarships, which encouraged
                    me to make greater efforts. In the master study, I am currently involved in the key project of National Natural
                    Foundation of China, which focuses on organization modeling and calculation of social management in the context
                    of network environment. It is closely linked with big data, which once again introduces me into the amazing world
                    of data processing and makes me aware of its significance towards the whole society. The more I know about data
                    processing, the deeper I want to probe into, thus I intend to study it further in PhD study.

                    Besides knowledge acquisition in classes, I also voluntarily participated in various mathematical modeling competitions,
                    which not merely enhanced my thinking, essay writing and problem-solving abilities, but also in turn facilitated my
                    academic studies. The topics covered scheduling, optimization and data mining and often serving as the team leader,
                    I was primarily responsible for essay writing and modeling. Due to various reasons, my team has gone through many
                    difficulties but we never stepped back. On the contrary, I doubled the efforts and also inspired my partners to move
                    forward. Our dedication eventually paid off as we won several prizes in the competitions. More importantly, not only
                    did I reinforce my mathematical modeling capacity but also realize that a good state of mind and cooperation sense
                    were of vital importance in study and research. Also delightfully, I tutored one of the younger mentees in our
                    university, upgrading him from a new comer of this field to the outstanding winner of MCM for two consecutive years,
                    which allowed me to enjoy great gratification from sharing my knowledge with others. Besides this, I also engaged
                    in some innovative practice competition, in which I learned to detect problems, raise question and get familiar with
                    the research methods, as well as drew on the precious experience from the excellent partners. I have also applied the
                    patent for some of my products made in these competitions.

                    Speech contest and debate competition are also the other highlights of my campus life, which helps me escape from the
                    heavy academic pressure and also cultivates my capability beyond academic study. As a detail-oriented student, I spared
                    no efforts to make each time the best, thus I would do sufficient preparation before it, ranging from writing the speech
                    draft to training the speech eloquence. I used to lack of confidence in the beginning but bounced back under the support
                    of my partners and after a period of training. I tried to ignore the ranking and abandon the anxiety but only concentrated
                    on the specific task, which benefited me a lot and facilitated my winning of the championship. While for the debate
                    competition, I often invested spare time discussing the topics with my partners, aiming to find out the novel arguments
                    and evidence to support the debate. Every time when I worked with them, their innovation and stamina always deeply
                    influenced me, which also inspired me to work harder and keep pace with them. With our concerted efforts and perseverance,
                    we finally got remarkable result. Furthermore, the everlasting friendship, inspiring spirit and skills gained from it will
                    be beneficial to the rest of my life.
                </p>

                    I have experienced in person the formidable power data carried on, which will eventually drastically change our life.
                    However, a large number of professionals in this field are in highly demand in China to boost its future development.
                    Therefore, I intend to come back to China and seek a job in a consulting company or Internet company after completing
                    the PhD study, mainly in charge of the field of data analysis. I wish to enhance my professional knowledge and hone
                    practical skills in the PhD study, improving my competitiveness in a higher platform and better preparing me for future
                    challenge.
